# Other useful things to play with ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sometimes it's useful to pull a set of values out into a vector for
# use later in some filtering logic. 
# Example: we want to do a bunch of checks or logic with just humans from Tatooine.
tatooine_humans <- starwars %>% 
  filter(homeworld == 'Tatooine',
         species == 'Human') %>%
  pull(name)
# I'll often do this when cleaning data, sometimes to denote a subset of the data that
# I want to check later or that needs cleaning, or that I want to piece together with
# another set of data down the line.

# Vectors like these are especially useful in filtering functions and can help you
# avoid a big chain of if_else() statements. Here's a few (silly) examples:

# filter to homeworlds that start with s (this is much simpler than a bunch of if_else()'s)
starwars %>% 
  filter(homeworld %in% c("Stewjon", "Socorro", "Sullust", "Serenno", "Skako", "Shili"))

# assign a binary flag for "is this character at risk for sunburn" under the basic assumption
# that humans on the desert planet will all eventually get sunburned.
starwars %>% 
  mutate(sunburn_risk = if_else(name %in% tatooine_humans, 1, 0))
